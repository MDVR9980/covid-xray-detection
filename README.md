## Requirements
- Python >= 3.8
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-xray-detection.git
```
2. Download dataset from Kaggle: [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
3. Extract it and place inside the `data/` folder.

## Model
- CNN architecture
- Trained on chest X-ray images
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Output
- Trained model (.h5)
- Confusion matrix
- Grad-CAM visualizations
