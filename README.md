## 📦 Requirements
- Python >= 3.8
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-xray-detection.git
```
2. Download dataset from Kaggle: [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
3. Place the extracted data inside the `data/` directory.

## 🧠 Model
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Trained on chest X-ray images
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📊 Output
- Trained model (.h5)
- Confusion Matrix
- Grad-CAM visualizations
